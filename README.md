# CSCB58_Project
This repository contains the verilog files that we have implemented for the CSCB58 Project - Brick Breaker Game. This contain wall.v (module that use to draw the wall around the play field), ball.v (module that use to show and control the ball movement), brick.v (module that use to draw and control the brick), and paddle.v (module that use to display and control the paddle). However, they have been combined into project.v which contains all the modules in a single files.
